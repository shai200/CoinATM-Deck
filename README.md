# 🪙 CoinATM: Bitcoin to the Masses
### *Building the Future of Bitcoin Savings*

## ⚠️ The Problem
### *Bitcoin is revolutionary — but still out of reach for most people.*

- 💸 **Complex Access:**  
  Buying Bitcoin still requires navigating exchanges, wallets, seed phrases, and verification hurdles — intimidating for 90% of people.

- 🕰️ **Too Much Friction:**  
  For everyday users, the process takes too long and feels unsafe. They just want a “one-tap” experience, not a technical adventure.

- 🏦 **Traditional Finance Walls:**  
  Banks limit or block crypto purchases, and credit card processors often flag transactions as “high risk.”

- 🧩 **No Simple Savings Tools:**  
  There’s still no “set-it-and-forget-it” way to save Bitcoin automatically — like setting up a recurring deposit in your bank.

- 🌍 **The Global Gap:**  
  Billions of people in emerging markets have no stable access to financial services — but they *do* have smartphones.  
  Bitcoin could be their financial lifeline… if it were easy to use.

> “People don’t need another exchange — they need a **simple, trusted, automated way to own Bitcoin.**”
